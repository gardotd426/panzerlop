In the console type;

sudo X -configure

then 

nvidia-settings

Configure your monitor(s) settings.
click apply and then "Save to X conifiguration file"

Click Show Preview and copy the text that shows up.

> Next navigate to /etc/X11/ and open xorg.conf - paste what you copied.

OR

> Put the following into the Konsole: *

kate /etc/X11/xorg.conf

Once you've done one of the above options replace the contents of xorg.conf with the ones we copied from nvidia-settings and save it. 
'Kate' ( KDE's Text Editor ) will ask for your password to allow the file to be overwritten.


Done!



* Note for other distro's that don't have kate installed: You will need to a different program name and likely with sudo in front to overwrite the file.
