Why: Old Native port , was never given much love ! Game is avaliable through GOG and will install using Lutris as an alternative.

Issue: Crashing to desktop or running at 2 - 4 fps

Fix:

Right click the game in the Steam Library, select "Properties..."  

Now enable "Force the use of a specific Steam compatability tool" by checking the tickbox next to it. 

In the drop down box underneath, click the option "Steam Linux Runtime".

Navigate to: 

SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/BioShock Infinite/XGame/Config/BaseEngine.ini

^ You can also right click the game and view local files through that contex menu!

Now search for "Poolsize"

set both PoolSize values to 1024 Under the MemoryPools section 

Finally add the following to the games launch options.

Launch Options:

__GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=1 %command% 



Close the settings window, the game may update and hopefully should now run!
