--Getting the ISO

Head to https://kubuntu.org/ download the 21.04 LTS ( Long Term Support April 2023 ) or 21.10 ( Supported until July 2022) ISO. 
I recommend using the latest version personally and this guide will be using 21.10 – there is a debate about stability and attack surface to be had but 
I lean towards the newer is better for all the purposes I use my machine.


--Creating an Installation USB or CD/DVD

The ISO can be burned onto a CD/DVD if this is an option for you however any USB stick at or above 4gb is large enough and there is great free software 
that will automate the process of creating the bootable USB stick for you such as Unetbootin which works great on Linux or Rufus for Windows. 
These apps are popular and there is also more in depth documentation for how to use them online.


--Booting from the installation media

In order to boot from the USB you may need to get into your computers BIOS, the key varies from system to system but it’s often DEL, F2, F12 or Insert, 
refer to your motherboard manual to check this but when the computer first powers up it’s likely written on the screen.

Once in the BIOS you’ll need to find the media device you’re using and put it first in the boot order setting, some motherboards also have a key to 
open a boot menu without having to change the order, if you changed the order, save settings then reboot your machine.

There are many guides that will cover these parts of the install process in much greater detail but for the purpose of this overview it’s kept short.


--Graphical Installer

Select Kubuntu at the GRUB menu and then select ‘Try Kubuntu’, at this point you can mess around with a live system and see how it looks / feels – 
please note that this will not have any 3rd party (non-free) codecs or graphics drivers in this ‘Live’ environment so performance may vary. 
Right click in the bottom right where the language is shown as US if you need to configure it to be UK or any other layout as this might effect your 
install and making it impossible to login ( wrong symbols ). 

It is a very good way to troubleshoot issues, recover files from disks that have a broken Windows install for example and all kinds of 
troubleshooting in-case your Linux install might run into any problems. This is a massive benefit of the Linux ecosystem.

.. Before you install check your keyboard configuration by right clicking the keyboard option in the bottom right that jsays "US", through this menu
you can install your preffered layout and remove the other before even running the installer. It is annoying to get through the install just to find
your passwords don't work anymore due to a changed keyboard layout!

Select install Kubuntu from the desktop, follow through the installer steps for as prompted on screen for Language, Keyboard and Software settings.


... Now we come to the Disk Setup stage, if it hangs for over 5 mintes try closing the installer window and re-opening it (if it STILL gets stuck 
skip ahead to troubleshooting the installer https://github.com/panzerlop/panzerlop/blob/main/Stuck%20Kubuntu%20Installer%20Troubleshooting ).

For maximum security I recommend using the LVM with full disk encryption option here – it’s MORE complicated to set it up after install but offers 
full disk encryption to your files that means a hacker or person with your hard disk would still need to know the password you set to unencrypt the data.

Warning about passwords on crypt: on boot you’ll have to type this password to gain any access at all to your system, 
As mentioned earlier with the keyboard settings - I’ve had issues before where the installer in live mode is using by default US language keyboard.
THIS CAN EASILY BE FIXED BEFORE YOU RUN THE INSTALLER FROM THE LIVE DISK.

If you don’t care about the disk being encrypted then just select guided install with LVM or the default guided option. 
The Guided LVM option without encryption has seemed to have less kinks to iron out however I’ve used this guide step by step to set it up and 
it’s been bug-free for weeks. LVM stands for Logical Volume Management and makes it easy to resize partitions 
(Partitions basically put are allocated blocks of space on your computers storage- sometimes people resize them to make space for a second OS 
on the same disk etc).

BE SURE TO SELECT THE CORRECT DISK BEFORE YOU CLICK ANYTHING ELSE ! 

Whilst it installs set the time Zone and User Info then kick back and wait for the installer to be done, 
you’ll be prompted to remove the installation media and restart – if this is your only OS it will now restart and then boot into Kubuntu,
if not you may need to adjust your BIOS ‘boot order’ settings again to put the drive with Linux on it first. 

Later on you can update the software that detects and runs the OS (GRUB) with all your drives plugged in and it will even detect 
Windows partitions / disks so you may select one at boot up instead of having to keep changing the boot order.
