sudo apt install meson libsystemd-dev pkg-config ninja-build git libdbus-1-dev libinih-dev build-essential && sudo apt install cpufrequtils && echo 'GOVERNOR="performance"' | sudo tee /etc/default/cpufrequtils && sudo /etc/init.d/cpufrequtils restart && echo 'GOVERNOR="performance"' | sudo tee /etc/default/cpufrequtils && sudo /etc/init.d/cpufrequtils restart && gamemoded libgamemode0:i386 libgamemodeauto0:i386
