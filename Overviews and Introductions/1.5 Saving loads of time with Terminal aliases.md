Open the console and type the following;

  kate ~/.bash_aliases

In this file you can write commands that will run in the Terminal with a custom commmand set by a phrase you provide.

Alias examples:

> Show IP;

  alias myip='curl ipinfo.io/ip'

> In order to move up a folder simply by typing ".." we can use the following;

  alias cd..='cd ..'
  alias ..='cd ..'

> Display our current folder;

  alias path='echo -e ${PATH//:/\\n}'

> Easy alias to update software;

  alias update=' sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && flatpak update'

> CPU Govener to performance, Nvidia settings to Performance & Enables Gamemode

  alias gameset=' echo 'GOVERNOR="performance"' | sudo tee /etc/default/cpufrequtils && sudo /etc/init.d/cpufrequtils restart && nvidia-settings -a [gpu:0]/GpuPowerMizerMode=1 && gamemoded libgamemode0:i386 libgamemodeauto0:i386 ' 

                                                  Hope that made some sense...

- Now in the Konsole I can type the alias in to run those longer commands which is pretty useful!
