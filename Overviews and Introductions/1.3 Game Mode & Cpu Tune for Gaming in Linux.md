## Gamemode

Open the console and paste the following;

```
sudo apt install meson libsystemd-dev pkg-config ninja-build git libdbus-1-dev libinih-dev build-essential cpufrequtils gamemodedaemon
echo 'GOVERNOR="performance"' | sudo tee /etc/default/cpufrequtils && sudo /etc/init.d/cpufrequtils restart && echo 'GOVERNOR="performance"' | sudo tee /etc/default/cpufrequtils
sudo /etc/init.d/cpufrequtils restart && gamemoded libgamemode0:i386 libgamemodeauto0:i386
```

These commands install common dependencies, makes sure that the CPU is set to performance mode and then runs gamemode. 

Once ready leave the window open and run the desired game.

To run it again use;

gamemoded libgamemode0:i386 libgamemodeauto0:i386

You can also additionaly add this to many Steam game using Proton to enable FSR put the following into the games launch options 
or tweak the launcher for it in Lutris;

WINE_FSR_OVERRIDE=1 WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR=1 WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR_STRENGTH=1 %command%
