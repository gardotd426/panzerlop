Welcome to my collection of scripts, fixes and guides for Linux ( using K ubuntu ). Many guides work with a little tweaking under most Debian derivitives.

<b> Files preceded by a number assume previous number has been read and / or completed. </b>

The TASystemSettings.ini is for Rocket League - it makes it sharper and more optimised - fixing the blurry image. 

> Use Lutris to install Epic Games Launcher and then download Rocket League. 
> > Run Once. Exit.
> Right click Epic Games Store on Lutris and select 'Browse Files'
> You need to put the TASystemSettings.ini in /home/USERNAME/Games/epic-games-store/drive_c/users/USERNAME/Documents/My Games/Rocket League/TAGame/Config/ 

> Don't forget where I've written "USERNAME"  Replace it with your own actual username.

That .ini Works on Windows too ( Documents/My Games/Rocket League/TAGame/Config/ ).
