Issue: Crashing to desktop or running at 2 - 4 fps

Fix:

Right click the game in the Steam Library, select "Properties..."  

Now enable "Force the use of a specific Steam compatability tool" by checking the tickbox next to it. 

In the bdrop down box underneath, click the option "Steam Linux Runtime".

Close the settings window, the game may update and hopefully should now run!
