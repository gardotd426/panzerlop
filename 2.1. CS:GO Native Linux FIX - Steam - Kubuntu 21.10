In the Console first we'll do some dependency checks and install required libraries; 


sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386

sudo apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers libglx-mesa0:i386 mesa-vulkan-drivers:i386 libgl1-mesa-dri:i386 && sudo apt install wget gdebi-core && sudo apt install libtcmalloc-minimal4 && sudo apt install libgtk2.0-0:i386

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt upgrade


Reboot.


sudo apt-get install mesa-utils libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev libtcmalloc-minimal4


sudo updatedb


sudo apt install libtcmalloc-minimal4


Then navigate to the location where the game is installed, for me this is:

/home/USERNAME/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/bin

^^ Note: You'll have to show hidden folders to see ones that start with a ".", Click on the file explorer window and then press Ctrl + H.
The folders with the "." prefix will now become visible.

Open a Terminal window in this location and type the following;

cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtcmalloc_minimal.so.4.5.9 libtcmalloc_minimal.so.0 

Right click the game and set the launch options "-nojoy -novid"

Fin.

Extra note: I had this game randomly appear uninstalled anud wouldn't write an update, fixed this by removing it and it's corresponmding
configurtation in Steamapps > Compdata ( The number is the same as the URL shows on the St eam Store ( 730 ) ) - then follow the guide again 
from line 12.
