In your Steam library right click Resident Evil 6, select Properties  >  compatibility and then check the "Force the use of a specific Steam Play Compatibility tool" box
Make sure you select Proton 4.11-13

Next use the following in the console:

sudo apt install pipx
sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-venv
sudo apt install winetricks cabextract
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
pipx install protontricks

python3 -m pipx ensurepath

>>Close the console and open it again...

>>Next we change the compatability mode to windows XP and then install a needed media library to the games proton prefix.

protontricks 221040 winxp
protontricks 221040 -q wmp11

>> we need to download this pack that replaces a few videos that can cause crashes here's an upload I found :
https://www.mediafire.com/file/h710n7937rhwm6p/Fix_Black_Screen_Resident_Evil_6.rar

>>Right click Resident Evil 6 in Steam
In launch options put:
PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=60 %command%

[ You may not need that command but I find the audio can 'crackle' a bit in this game. ]

>> Now click on the tab that says "Local Files" and click "Browse..."
In the window that comes up go into the "nativePC "folder and then "movie"
Select all files inside the .rar we downloaded earlier and drag them into the "movie" folder. Select replace for all.

The game saves fine but you must complete the first level for a proper save to be made, you'll then go to the main menu.

Fin.

NOTE: Audio is perfect in single player but degrades / whistles when starting a lobby, have yet to try joining one.
