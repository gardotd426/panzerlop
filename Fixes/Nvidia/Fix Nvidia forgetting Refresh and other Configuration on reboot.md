First, open a terminal, then type:

```
sudo nvidia-settings
```

Type your password and hit enter.

 - Configure your monitor(s) settings.
 - Click apply and then "Save to X conifiguration file"
 - Choose /etc/X11/xorg.conf

Make sure after this, you also go into your Desktop Environment's Display Settings and set the same options for resolution and refresh rate.

# uhh where did the second part go ? Will redo it; it's taking the output from the nvidia driver GUI and having it auto apply on login
