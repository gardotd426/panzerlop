Why: Old Native port , was never given much love ! Game is avaliable through GOG and will install using Lutris as an alternative.

Issue: Crashing to desktop or running at 2 - 4 fps

Fix:

Right click the game in the Steam Library, select "Properties..."  

Now enable "Force the use of a specific Steam compatability tool" by checking the tickbox next to it. 

In the drop down box underneath, click the option "Steam Linux Runtime".

Add the following to the games launch options.

Launch Options:

__GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=1 %command% 


---> [[! This section may not be the correct . file iniNavigate to: 

SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/BioShock Infinite/XGame/Config/BaseEngine.ini

^ You can also right click the game and view local files through that contex menu!

Now search for "Poolsize"

set both PoolSize values to 1024 Under the MemoryPools section !]] <---


Close the settings window, the game may update and hopefully should now run!


!! Due to what seems to be an error with the memory pool you'll find best results with the textures on normal !! 
the game still looks amazing here's the settings I use ( main ones);

- Texture: Normal
- Filtering: Ultra
- Dynamic Shadows: High ( or normal )

fin.
