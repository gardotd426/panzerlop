Open the gamae location for example;

/media/redacted/Data/SteamLibrary2/steamapps/common/Max Payne 2 The Fall of Max Payne/

 >>  you can also click the game in steam and open the game folder the from the properties menu.

^ ensure both zip scontents are extracted to the correct places ( "Max Payne 2 The Fall of Max Payne ").

>> Reboot.
