Install Max Payne 3 and run it at least once with Steam Proton, I used Experimental.

MODS:

> ( Max Payne III Realistic Blood MOD )

https://www.nexusmods.com/maxpayne3/mods/19?tab=files

Download the zip file.

https://openiv.com/

Download OpenIV and run it using WINE program loader.

Select Max Payne 3, Input the Location where the game is installed

Here is an example:

Z:\media\redacted\Data\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Max Payne 3\Max Payne 3\

Open OpenIV, via desktop shortcut if one was made or by searching in the application launcher.

Drop the files from the zip inside the Max Payne 3 file like so:

Drop bloodfx.dat and charbloodfx.dat onto \Max Payne 3\common.rpf\data\effects

Then drop fxprojtex.wtd on \Max Payne 3\pc.rpf\textures

close edit mode.


> (Remove (Most) Flashy Screen Effects)

https://www.nexusmods.com/maxpayne3/mods/8?tab=description

download and extract the .oiv from the zip file

Go to OpenIV then > Tools > select -> package installer

load the downloaded file

the installer looks glitchy bit I Just clicked accept a few times and waited til it was done installing.

> ( Colored 3D Weapon Icons )

In OpenIV goto pc.rpf\textures\

Enable edit mode then drop payne_weapons_white.wtd here.

Open downloaded 7zip then paste the "pc" fderfiles into the Max Payne 3 Folder ( /steamapps/common/Max Payne 3/Max Payne 3/ )



To enable FSR add the following to the Launch Options ( this works for all WINE Proton games ).

WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR=1 %command%

Other variables:

WINE_FSR_OVERRIDE=1 WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR=1 WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR_STRENGTH=1 %command%
