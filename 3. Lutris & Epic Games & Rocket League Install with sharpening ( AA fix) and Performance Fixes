Lutris is a great compatability tool that automates setting up games to work under WINE / PROTON with thousands of user scripts!

Open your Terminal:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:lutris-team/lutris && sudo apt update && sudo apt install lutris

 - Run Lutris...

https://lutris.net/games/epic-games-store/

Since there are currently no uploaded Lutris scripts that do anything other than install the 'Epic Games Store', it makes sense to just use the latest Lutris installer for the 'Epic Games Store'.

Once it loads and you've logged in to the Epic Launcher download Rocket League.

Go to Lutris, right click 'Epic Games Store' and select browse files...
Navigate to epic-games-store/drive_c/users/USERNAME/Documents/My Games/Rocket League/TAGame/Config/

^^ Again please replace USERNAME with your own.

Right click insie the folder > create new text file > empty the name input box and put the following: TASystemSettings.ini

Open it with Kate ( or any text editor ).

Paste the contents as they are here: https://github.com/panzerlop/panzerlop/blob/main/TASystemSettings.ini

Setting the game to Windowed felt like it had a much lower input latency on my dual-screen setup, so that's worth a try aswell.

I also reccomend you uncheck both options in "Desktop Notifcations" from Epic Launchers 'Settings' because they are glitchy and can hang on screen.

NOte, to change the anti aliasing, incase you need more frames the main settings are here
change the following:

MaxMultiSamples=8

I'd start with 2 - 4 depenuding on your systemi ^

bAllowD3D9MSAA=true

I also recomend you set the file to read only!
