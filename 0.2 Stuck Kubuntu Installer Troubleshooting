0.5 Troubleshooting a hanging installer

This section briefly explains the most common problem I’ve seen when installing Kubuntu 20.10
The few issues I’ve ever ran into during install have been due to badly formatted hard disks or having plugged in Windows drives. 

Another common trouble shooting step is to use the “Live” option and close the installer when it hangs, re-open it and try again. 

Check for any unneeded USB’s connected.

Run the KDE Partition manager from the live USB. I used this to reformat my drive as ext4 after which installation was perfectly smooth the 
one time I encountered this – be sure to click apply when you’ve made changes. You can try to use this to format or unmount all drives 
besides the intended install destination ( and install medium ) – this is a great option if you don’t have physical access to remove 
any drives in order to avoid accidentally breaking them.
