0. Why Linux? Why care?

Linux is an open source project that has been developed since 1991, the vast majority of internet infrastructure and cloud services run on systems based from 
Linux – it’s free and secure. 

I chose Kubuntu ( A flavour of Ubuntu ) because most support for Ubuntu applies which has a huge community – this means most errors you could encounter have 
likely already been solved. There has been huge development recently for the gaming end on Linux with EAC support coming soon and Steam’s Proton bringing 
over 16,000 Windows games to Linux – their version of Linux for Steam Deck uses KDE as well as Kubuntu does so I predict it’ll only get better. 

Linux MINT is also a great friendly distribution for new users but it’s main flavour Cinnamon performs badly in graphical applications sadly ( uses mutter ) 
- it is also based from Ubuntu but comes packaged with it’s own software(s) which tend to have a little less information online - a lot of this guide still applies.

Societies all around the world have been abusing the right to privacy for a long time and it’s only been getting worse with the introduction of the 
Snoopers Charter in the UK and secret two year trials in collaboration with ISP’s to record every users entire history (as of 2021). 

I believe that current and proposed levels of mass surveillance are morally unwarranted and that to peacefully resist we must stop giving our information 
and privacy away. Massive tech industries are taking in insane profits and playing into social manipulation  allowing corrupt Governments to discriminate 
against political dissidents and innocent people.

Even if you are politically aligned with your country, imagine if more extreme or contrasting new political sectors of society can inherit the already 
existing surveillance infrastructure and enforce new rules.
This then poses the question that perhaps all surveillance systems must be regarded in terms of how they can be abused in the future?

There are many people out there complicit in passive agreement through inaction. But I strongly believe every sane person should be willing to 
give up at least some convenience in order to protect yours and the future of privacy.
