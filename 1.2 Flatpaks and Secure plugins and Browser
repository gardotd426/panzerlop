Whilst the default browser of Firefox is a good open-sourced projects it’s caused a stir with some of the development choices as of late, 
luckily there is a great fork of the Firefox code which has many many built in security optimisations ( seriously there’s loads ) It’s called Librewolf.

Open your konsole and use the following command to install it, or you may simply go to the flathub page and click install !

	flatpak install flathub io.gitlab.librewolf-community

If you go to the flathub it’s a good time to integrate support in Discover for Flatpaks, this helps aid ensuring you’re always updated. 
https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.gitlab.librewolf-community
Click the ‘Install’ button and open with Discover, if this is the first time you are installing a flatpak you’ll see this screen, click the install button.

Once installed, click run then restart your PC or log out and in from your session.

Now when you go back to the flathub site you’ll be able to click install and see the correct program come up in Discorver.
At the time of writing this, there’s an issue with installing this way out the box but it can be quickly fixed in the Konsole with the following:
      
 	sudo apt install plasma-discover-backend-flatpak
 	flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
Reboot and try again – this fixed it for me and having Discover update the system & applications & let you browse thousands of them is super convenient. 
Again, this is what I mean when I say that you don;t have to sit staring at a Konsole all the time. It’s faster and safer than other OS. 

If you do not wish to use Librewolf all the time then I recommend you install the uBlock Origin plug-in (pre-installed with Librewolf) and the plug-ins I’ll 
be talking about next;

uBlock Origin is a great open sourced ad-blocker that is low on system resources.

Please ensure any Firefox add-ons you get are from the official addons.mozilla.org and don’t install too many un-neccecary ones – 
plug-ins are a big attack vector for bad actors.

Next install Decentraleyes as described on the plugin’s page
 
“Protects you against tracking through "free", centralized, content delivery. It prevents a lot of requests from reaching networks like Google Hosted Libraries
and serves local files to keep sites from breaking. Complements regular content blockers.”

next up is HTTPS everywhere by the Electronic Fronteir Foundation, it enforces the use of Secure HTTP across the web – this avoids leaking information to snoopers.

Librewolf automatically forgets “cookies” after it’s closed, these are little bits of metadata that remember where you’re logged in and can also be a security 
concern – if you don’t like re-logging in to things I recommend you manually clear your cookies daily or weekly in Firefox or installing a plug-in to do the same.

For quality of life in Librewolf I recommend installing the “I don't care about cookies by Kiko”  plug-in or else you’re going to be clicking accept all a LOT 
in the EU.

Now VPN time, the most anonymous use and best services I can recommend would be Mullivad for a paid ( takes Bitcoin payment, no account just a randomly 
generated number to input ) or ProtonVPN free but it’s limited and I can’t vouch for it – Protonmail however is often recommended as an encrypted alternative 
to G*ogle Mail and is completely free! 

Installing Mullivad in Kubuntu is easy simply download the .deb package and open it with Discover then click install. ( Note you may need to go to your 
download folder and right click > open with > select Discover )

Whatever VPN you use, for maximum security check they have a “Kill-Switch” this means that if your connection to the VPN disconnects the VPN software 
will block your internet – this stops accidental information leaks about you.


You are already much safer than before but remember to practice good online safety at all times regardless. 

- Verify your sources for programs, search for user feedback. Check the MD5 hash of downloaded programs.

- Always check you are on the official website you are trying to access.

- Do not use your VPN to log into things such as Facebook that may be associated with your unmasked IP or real name / email / phone number.

- Avoid Facebook, Google and Amazon services in general if it can be helped.

- Be smart, always second-think if you trust the provider of software and web services before using them.

- Use an encrypted password manager like https://keepassxc.org/ to store passwords and use different ones for different sites.
