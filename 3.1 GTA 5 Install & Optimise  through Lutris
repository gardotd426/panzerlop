Lutris already installed as shown in previous documents

( https://github.com/panzerlop/panzerlop/blob/main/Lutris%20&%20Epic%20Games%20&%20Rocket%20League%20Install%20with%20sharpening%20(%20AA%20fix)%20and%20Performance%20Fixes )

So I went to the Lutris website and clicked the latest installer.

https://lutris.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v/ 

In Lutris right click the game and then go 'Runner Options'. Enable AMD FidelityFX Siper Resolution (FSR) - this can help improve performance.

DO NOT PUT THIS GAME ONTO DX11, LEAVE IT ON DX 10.
