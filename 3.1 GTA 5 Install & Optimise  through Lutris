So I used the Lutris website to click the latest installer.

In Lutris right click the game and then go 'Runner Options'. Enable AMD FidelityFX Siper Resolution (FSR) - this can help improve performance.

DO NOT PUT THIS GAME ONTO DX11, LEAVE IT ON DX 10.

->>> note after an hour the game became a lot more stable in terms of FPS. 
Otherwise perfectly playable with 0 crashes an hour in single player and the multiplayer mode.
