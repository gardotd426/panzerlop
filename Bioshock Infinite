Issue: Crashing to desktop or running at 2 - 4 fps

Fix:

Right click the game in the Steam Library, select "Properties..."  

Now enable "Force the use of a specific Steam compatability tool" by checking the tickbox next to it. 

In the box underneat click on it, navigate down to "Steam Linux Runtime" 

Close the settings window and the game should now run perfectly.
