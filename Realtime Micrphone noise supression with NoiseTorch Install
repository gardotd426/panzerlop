"NoiseTorch is an easy to use open source application for Linux with PulseAudio or PipeWire. 
It creates a virtual microphone that suppresses noise, in any application. 
Use whichever conferencing or VOIP application you like and simply select the NoiseTorch Virtual Microphone as input 
to "torch" the sound of your mechanical keyboard, computer fans, trains and the likes."

download the latest .tgz

right click > extract here, show hidden files with crtl + h, then copy the .local and drag it into your home directory. 

Next run this in the console:

sudo setcap 'CAP_SYS_RESOURCE=+ep' ~/.local/bin/noisetorch

If the shortcut in the Application Menu doesn't work you can just go and run noisetorch from /home/redacted/.local/bin/
then pin it to the application bar for convenience ( !! replace redacted with your username !! ).

Now once you have run it and selected your microphone - 
using any program like OBS select 'Noise Torch' as the input device. 

It should now be working!
