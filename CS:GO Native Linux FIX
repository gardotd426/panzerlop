As many will know CS:GO native and other native games have only been running in the Flatpak version for the last couple of weeks or so, last night I finally got it to work here's the steps:


In the Console:


sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386


sudo apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers libglx-mesa0:i386 mesa-vulkan-drivers:i386 libgl1-mesa-dri:i386 && sudo apt install wget gdebi-core && sudo apt install libtcmalloc-minimal4 && sudo apt install libgtk2.0-0:i386

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt upgrade


Reboot.


sudo apt-get install mesa-utils libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev libtcmalloc-minimal4


sudo updatedb


sudo apt install libtcmalloc-minimal4


Then navigate to the location where the game is installed, for me this is:

/home/USERNAME/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/bin

Open a Terminal window in this location and type the following.

cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtcmalloc_minimal.so.4.5.9 libtcmalloc_minimal.so.0 

Right click the game and set the launch options "-nojoy -novid"


Enjoy.

PS (from comments):

The issue seems to be with distro's that have updated glibc to 2.34, such as Fedora and Kubuntu
